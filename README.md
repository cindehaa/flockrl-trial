# flockrl-trial

For WAT.ai FlockRL's trial project: Use the FrozenLake-v1 environment from Gymnasium. Implement a simple tabular Q-learning algorithm that learns to reach the goal without falling into holes. After training, show the learned Q-table and run a short demo episode of the agent navigating the environment.
